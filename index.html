	<h2>1) Stay organized</h2>
	<p>It’s so much easier to become frustrated when you’re disorganized. Try to keep a routine and keep your workplace clean and organized. If you have a routine, you’ll be less likely to procrastinate and leave off all your work until the last minute. In other words, if you have a routine, you’ll be a lot less stressed out!</p>

	<h2>2) Sleep</h2>
	<p>I know it’s tempting to stay up all night and watch Netflix…</p><br>

	<p>…but sleep smart! Sleep is integral for healthy brain function. Although it’s very difficult to maintain eight full hours of sleep during the school year, it’s important to try to get as much sleep as is possible. Spend less time vegetating on social media and more time catching those z’s! </p>
	<h2>3) Stay Active</h2>
	<p>Physical exercise is essential for a healthy lifestyle. It’s also a great way to de-stress. Try doing some jumping jacks in between study sessions—or going for a brisk walk. Yoga is  also great ways to relieve tension! Sign up for a  weight lifting class or buy a yoga mat and learn online! Also, you can follow health and wellness sites on social media like Men's Health and Women's Health, or download an exercise app on your phone that keeps track of your steps which could motivate you to do some exercises at home,</p><img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/04/27/08/29/sport-2264825_960_720.jpg" alt="Active">
